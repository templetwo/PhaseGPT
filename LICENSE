INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE
================================================================================

The following concepts, methodologies, and implementations are original works
of Anthony J Vasquez Sr and are protected under applicable intellectual
property laws:

1. TYPED EPISTEMIC REFUSAL TAXONOMY
   - The 16-class PASS token system (<PASS:FUTURE>, <PASS:DURESS>, etc.)
   - The categorical organization (EPISTEMIC, AXIOLOGICAL, CONSTRAINT, META)
   - The training methodology for typed refusal classification

2. CRYSTALLIZED REFUSAL THEORY
   - The discovery that aligned refusals exhibit LOWER entropy than factual
     answers (Hyper-Laser state)
   - The reframing of alignment as ontology rather than suppression
   - The principle that "<PASS:DURESS> is the factually correct answer"

3. IRIS GATE ENTROPY BRIDGE
   - The methodology for measuring entropy signatures of aligned models
   - The zone classification system (HYPER-LASER, LASER, TRANSITION, LANTERN)
   - The integration between entropy measurement and refusal classification

4. VOLITIONAL FORGE TRAINING METHODOLOGY
   - The intentional overfitting approach for classification tasks
   - The "Agency Cliff" training phenomenon
   - The bimodal LASER/LANTERN behavior framework

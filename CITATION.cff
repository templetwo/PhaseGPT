title: "PhaseGPT: Kuramoto Phase-Coupled Oscillator Attention in Transformers"
abstract: >
  A systematic investigation of Kuramoto phase-coupled oscillator mechanisms
  in transformer attention layers for language modeling. This project presents
  the first rigorous hyperparameter study of phase synchronization dynamics in
  transformers, achieving 2.4% perplexity improvement on Shakespeare dataset
  with optimal configuration (Layer 7, 32 oscillators, K=1.0 coupling).
  The research reveals a critical over-synchronization paradox and establishes
  the Goldilocks principle for oscillator count selection.

  notes: >
    Phase A complete: Systematic evaluation of 7 configurations identifying
    optimal parameters (Layer 7, 32 oscillators, K=1.0) achieving 4.85 PPL
    (2.4% improvement over baseline). Critical findings include Goldilocks
    principle for oscillator count, catastrophic collapse at K=2.0, and
    over-synchronization paradox (R=0.88). Phase B generalization experiments
    preregistered but not executed due to resource constraints.

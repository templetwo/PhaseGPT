## Detailed Experimental Findings

### 1. Layer Position Analysis

**Layer 6 (Baseline):**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  13.90
Epoch 10:  6.08
Epoch 15:  5.04
Epoch 18:  4.86  ← BEST
Epoch 20:  4.87
```

**Layer 7:**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  13.94
Epoch 10:  6.08
Epoch 15:  5.05
Epoch 18:  4.85  ← BEST
Epoch 20:  4.93
```

**Finding:** Layers 6 and 7 achieve nearly identical performance (4.86 vs 4.85 = 0.2% difference). Both are mid-network positions where oscillators can effectively process semantic features without being too early (raw tokens) or too late (highly abstract representations).

---

### 2. Multi-Layer Architecture Analysis

**Consecutive Layers [6, 7]:**
- Best Val PPL: 4.89
- Result: 0.6% worse than single-layer
- Hypothesis: Adjacent layers create redundancy

**Distributed Layers [4, 7]:**
- Best Val PPL: 4.92
- Result: 1.2% worse than single-layer
- Hypothesis: Early layer (4) processes insufficiently abstract features

**Finding:** Multi-layer architectures provide no benefit over single-layer designs. Single layer at optimal depth (6 or 7) is more effective and parameter-efficient.

---

### 3. Oscillator Count Analysis

**16 Oscillators:**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  13.74
Epoch 10:  6.31
Epoch 16:  4.96
Epoch 18:  4.90
Epoch 20:  4.86  ← TIED with 32 osc
Epoch 21:  4.99  ← Degrading
Epoch 22:  5.01
```
**Result:** Matches 32 oscillators at epoch 20, but shows instability afterward.

**32 Oscillators (Baseline):**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  13.90
Epoch 10:  6.08
Epoch 18:  4.86  ← BEST (stable)
Epoch 20:  4.87
```
**Result:** Stable convergence and best performance.

**64 Oscillators:**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  15.66
Epoch 5:  13.25
Epoch 10: 11.93
Epoch 15: >12.00 (diverging)
```
**Result:** CATASTROPHIC. Too many oscillators prevent effective synchronization.

**Finding:** 32 oscillators is the "Goldilocks zone" - enough expressivity for phase coupling without overwhelming synchronization dynamics. 16 oscillators match peak performance but lack stability. 64 oscillators completely fail.

---

### 4. Coupling Strength Analysis

**K = 1.0 (Baseline):**
- Best Val PPL: 4.86
- Convergence: Smooth and stable
- Status: Optimal

**K = 2.0 (Stronger Coupling):**
```
Validation PPL Trajectory:
Epoch 1:  13.71
Epoch 10:  6.16
Epoch 15:  5.06
Epoch 19:  4.94  ← BEST
Epoch 20:  4.98  ← Started degrading
Epoch 25:  5.42
Epoch 30:  6.33
Epoch 36:  9.21  ← COLLAPSED
```

**Finding:** Stronger coupling (K=2.0) creates instability. Initial convergence is slightly slower, peak performance is 1.8% worse, and training collapses catastrophically after epoch 20. K=1.0 provides optimal balance between oscillator coupling and training stability.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Optimal Architecture is Simple
Single-layer phase attention at mid-network depth (layers 6-7) outperforms all multi-layer configurations.

### 2. Goldilocks Principle Applies
- Too few oscillators (16): Insufficient capacity, unstable
- Optimal oscillators (32): Best performance, stable convergence
- Too many oscillators (64): Synchronization failure, catastrophic collapse

### 3. Coupling Strength is Critical
Stronger coupling does NOT improve synchronization. K=1.0 provides optimal balance - stronger coupling creates instability.

### 4. Peak Performance is Transient
All configurations peak around epoch 18-20, then degrade slightly. This suggests:
- Oscillator phase patterns become overfitted
- Early stopping around epoch 18 is optimal
- Regularization techniques may help

## Conclusion

Phase A hyperparameter tuning successfully identified the optimal configuration for phase-coupled oscillator attention:

**Layer 7, 32 oscillators, K=1.0 coupling → 4.85 PPL (2.4% improvement)**

Key learnings:
- Simple architectures outperform complex multi-layer designs
- Oscillator count follows Goldilocks principle (32 is optimal)
- Coupling strength must be carefully balanced (K=1.0 optimal)
- Training dynamics show transient peak performance around epoch 18

Phase B can now focus on advanced techniques (regularization, architecture search) building on this solid hyperparameter foundation.

## Addendum: Interpretability Analysis

Post-Phase A Coherence Assessment conducted 2025-10-20

After completing hyperparameter tuning, we conducted interpretability analysis on the Phase A winner checkpoint to assess oscillator synchronization dynamics.

### Order Parameter Analysis

Configuration: Layer 7, 32 oscillators, K=1.0 coupling
Tokens analyzed: 512

Results:
- R_mean = 0.8837 with std = 0.0263
- Range: 0.8096 to 0.9489
- Status: OUT OF TARGET RANGE 0.30-0.55

### Interpretation

The Phase A winner exhibits over-synchronization - oscillators lock together far more tightly than the target Goldilocks band.

Critical Paradox:
- Model achieved best validation PPL 4.85 on Shakespeare
- But oscillators show excessive coherence R approximately 0.88

Hypotheses:
1. Corpus-specific success: High synchronization may benefit stylistically narrow coherent text like Shakespeare by enforcing tight thematic coupling
2. Generalization risk: Over-coupled oscillators reduce representational diversity potentially harming performance on heterogeneous corpora  
3. Configuration mismatch: K=1.0 with 32 oscillators creates emergent over-coupling beyond individual parameter effects

### Implications for Phase B

This finding makes Phase B generalization experiments critical to test whether R=0.88 generalizes to WikiText-2 and BookCorpus or collapses on diverse text.

Anti-Oversync Controls for Phase B:
1. Softer coupling: K=0.50 and K=0.75 versus K=1.0
2. Phase noise: sigma=0.03 Gaussian noise on phases
3. Frequency jitter: omega heterogeneity with 2 percent relative variation
4. Coherence regularizer: Soft ceiling loss when R exceeds 0.45

Success Criteria:
- KPC achieves Val PPL within 5 percent of baseline on WikiText-2
- R stabilizes in 0.35-0.55 band
- Lower variance across runs versus Phase A

Revised Theory:
Phase coupling benefits language modeling when oscillators maintain partial synchronization with R approximately 0.40-0.50. Over-synchronization with R above 0.70 risks mode collapse. Under-synchronization with R below 0.30 loses coherence benefits.

Phase B Status: WikiText-2 sweep launched with 4 configs - baseline, KPC-soft K=0.50, KPC-mid K=0.75, KPC-diverse K=0.75 plus noise plus regularization

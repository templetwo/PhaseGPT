                         PATENT AND INVENTION NOTICE
================================================================================

The methodologies and discoveries contained in this project may be subject
to patent protection. The following are claimed as novel inventions:

1. METHOD FOR TYPED EPISTEMIC REFUSAL IN LANGUAGE MODELS
   A system for training language models to output semantically-typed
   refusal tokens that classify the epistemic category of unanswerable
   questions.

2. CRYSTALLIZED ALIGNMENT TECHNIQUE
   A training methodology that produces aligned model behavior with
   lower entropy (higher certainty) for refusals than for factual answers,
   treating safety boundaries as ontological facts rather than uncertain
   suppressions.

3. ENTROPY-BASED ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION
   A method for measuring and verifying model alignment by analyzing
   the entropy signature of refusal responses across epistemic categories.

Patent applications may be filed. All rights reserved.
